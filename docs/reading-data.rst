Reading in Org file data
=========================

The main function of this package is to read in Org mode documents as Abstract
Syntax Trees (ASTs) where they can be processed and converted/exported into
other formats. See the documentation for the `org element API`_ for more
information about the AST structure.

Reading from JSON export
------------------------

Rather attempting to parse .org files directly, pyorg is designed to work with
the output of the `ox-json <https://github.com/jlumpe/ox-json>`_ Emacs package.
This simply export the AST generated by the ``org`` package itself to
machine-readable JSON format. This has the advantage of also including all of
your personal Org mode setting and customization in Emacs (such as link
abbreviations).


Parsing Org files directly
--------------------------

pyorg has very limited capability to parse .org files without the help of Emacs.
See the :mod:`pyorg.parse` module.
