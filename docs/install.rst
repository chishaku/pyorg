Installation
============

Emacs dependencies
------------------

pyorg requires the `ox-json <https://github.com/jlumpe/ox-json>`_ package be
installed in Emacs in order to be able to extract syntax trees from files.


Installing the package
----------------------

Just clone the repository and run the setup script::

	git clone https://github.com/jlumpe/pyorg
	cd pyorg
	python setup.py install
